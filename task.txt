GET /users - List all users = HTML document
GET /api/users - List all users = JSON document
GET /api/Users/1 - Get the user with ID 1
GET /api/users/2 - Get the user with ID 2
Here ID is a dynamic path parameter
GET /api/users/:id (colon means dynamic)

POST /api/users - Create a new user

PATCH /api/users/ID - Edit the user with the ID

DELETE /api/users/ID - Delete the user with the ID
Using mockaru to generate fake data

As the get patch and delete methods have same route we can create app.route
app.route can handle multiple methods using express easily without the need to write the code multiple times
